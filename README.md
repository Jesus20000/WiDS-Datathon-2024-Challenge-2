## Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model to predict the metastatic diagnosis period using data from the WiDS Datathon 2024 Challenge. This repository includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation steps.

## Data

The dataset is split into training and testing sets:
- `train.csv`: Contains the training data
- `test.csv`: Contains the test data

## Installation

To run the code in this repository, you need to have Python installed along with several libraries. You can install the necessary libraries using the following command:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
